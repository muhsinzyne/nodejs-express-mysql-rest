# Headless Express Framework 🚀

As a developer, I was on the lookout for a headless framework in Express that met my scalability and maintainability expectations. Unfortunately, none did, which led me to create this project.

## What to Expect 🤔

A fully-fledged, headless Express project designed for scalability. It's a kickstart solution for any upcoming scalable projects. This package includes:

- RESTful API
- Architecture management integrations (Bull-Board, Swagger, etc.)
- Seamless module control via flags
- Easily customizable without heavy refactoring

## Current Tech Stack ⚙️

- Node.js (LTS)
- Express
- MariaDB
- TypeORM
- BullMQ
- Redis Cache
- JWT & Auth0

## What's Next 🚀

- Message brokers (Pusher, Firebase)
- Web, mobile, desktop notifications
- PDF generators from templates, and more!
